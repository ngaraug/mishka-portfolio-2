Aren’t we all wasting our time as such fighting every day to be together with someone then why waste time by not loving them not telling them what you feel, not telling you care, not letting go, not holding on. Life seems very short when you have a partner and very long and when you don’t so if you have why not keep them forever. Why not fight for `us’ instead of `me’ why not fight to stay why not fight so that nothing comes along your beautiful relation. Why not know the difference between holding on and letting go!"

A future which comes out of all the incomplete dreams and the disappointments of today, but what guarantee do we have that the future we see today has a chance of coming true? Are we suppose to imagine a future and expect it to go the same way? if not then why imagine a future? Humans are the kind which survive on hopes and our hope is future. Imagining a future only gives pain. why you may ask. it’s because we expect something to come true which has come out of our imagination. We accomplish our dreams but can we accomplish our future plans. The difference between dreams and future is that, dreams are our imaginations of what we want in our life but future, it is a hope of what we want our lives to look like. The only way to not fear from the fear of future is to stick to our dreams, is to know that even if things don't go the way we wanted them, there is always a loophole. A loophole into something unexpected and something beautiful."

If it is then why do people search for so many answers and cure to loneliness? There is this feeling you get where you don’t know what exactly you want, what exactly is the thing that is bothering you and no matter how much you try to tell yourself that it is okay, you know it’s not. Sometimes all you need is assurance that it’s okay to be happy alone, and that assurance can be given to you by none but you. Maybe a look outside, or a heartfelt song, or a quote, or a selfie can make that happen. There are times when the noise of fireworks gives a soothing feeling, reassuring us we are not alone. There are days when all you want is noise, crowd, chaos around you, and even though those days seem bad but they bring out the best in us."

I one day found myself questioning that will I ever get someone to do all that stuff for me and the answer to that question is still vague. one day I decided to do all that stuff for myself. Woke up and greeted myself, got dressed ( for myself), went out, and did everything I wanted someone else to do and it felt so good. True, we would like to have someone in our life who does things for us but not cause we can't do it ourselves, the feeling of someone's existence in our life I great but not at the cost of losing one own's. Sometimes some people get the perfect partner and it works for life and sometimes no matter what we do it just doesn't works. Maybe the problem is us cause we are trying too hard, maybe if we just sit back and get busy trying loving ourself than maybe we won't try or try to find that one person. and as they say we shouldn't need someone we should want them so why not apply it? There are times you may feel incomplete but the missing person is not them it’s you, the missing thing is the realisation that the incomplete spot is your heart's way of reminding that it needs your love and time.

Who gets to decide what a grown-up is like and what surety is there that grown-ups don't mess things up? Sometimes people at 60 need to grow up. Let's define what is grown-ups. Making the right choice? taking the right decision? talking in a manner? getting good grades? what is that define grown-ups cause as far as I have seen the grown-ups I know have made mistakes. We never really grow up. do we? Even the right decisions lead to some unhappy times, even good grades can't assure manners. Humans are complicated and emotional which why no matter how \"GROWN UP\" we are, we will always do things that will make us feel we need to grow up but there is such thing called all grown up cause we are going to keep doing stupid things no matter how old we are or how experienced we are so instead of saying Grow Up shouldn't we say experience more. I think one is never ready to grow up because everybody has that one little innocent part in them which makes them want to stop growing up. We all have that one voice inside us which provokes us to take hasty decisions, a part which is curious to know where our other decisions will take us. After all don't we all want to stop growing up?"

Our generation isn't satisfied with only money, a little part of us wants to be known, wants to be recognized, appreciated. Our generation is competitive, not necessarily with others but with their selves as well. We question what our future holds for ourselves too early and when we see young people are achieving things, we start to ask this question more often to ourselves. We get this feeling that if they can do then why can't we and slowly its pile a negative thought. Having ambition at a young age is progressive but achieving those at that same age is not obligatory. If our generation can normalize fear of social media, fear of looks, and beauty then I guess our generation can normalize being confused at the age of 24. True we live in a world where making your own identity is everything but being recognized for it is a great thing but it is okay if your identity is known by a few people. Sometimes it's not about how much or how many recognitions you get sometimes it's about the small achievements, even though those achievements aren't a big deal in your resume but those achievements are a small reminder for you that you did it, you created your own small identity. For days I felt that I am just a useless 19-year-old making reels and not get appreciated but then I came to this realization that the reels I made gave me happiness and even if my reels crossed just 1000 views that are an achievement. It's great if you have it all figured out at just 19 but it's also okay to still be figuring it all out at 25. The question of what the future holds is scary but it's not always necessary to ask that."

What happens when two such people meet? one with lots of hidden emotions and one who is prepared to not feel emotions. They destruct each other. One wrecks the other by overwhelming emotions and the other makes you want to think about how you feel things. In both cases which one do you think can survive? Makes you want to think about which one are you. sometimes we feel emotions which are not needed to be felt cause those emotions just hit you with no intention of making you do something about them so isn't leaving those emotions a right decision to make? I believe that we are never completely done with any emotion I feel the emotion just takes over and someday you get a pile of unfelt emotions. We don't really have the time to get over one emotion. do we? All we do leave that emotion half felt and start to feel another. So what happens to those unfelt emotions? They become stationery items, items we only remember when we need to create or destroy something."

It might be true, you never really get over someone, you just start to get a more strong and different feeling for someone else. I always wondered what happens to the old feelings but I finally got the answer. They fade, they don't wipe out completely but they fade. Sometimes it is because you are done feeling that feeling, sometimes it is because you overcame that feeling, sometimes it’s because you don't get time to think about that feeling, or sometimes cause you are drained, drained from that feeling and you get so used to that feeling that eventually, it stops bothering you. Someday, at some point that feeling might be remembered but not with the same emotion. You might feel right now that this will never fade or you will never get over it but you will, willingly or unwillingly you will. There is no guarantee when, how or with what you will overcome that feeling but you will cause there will come a time when you will start to feel something else. Good or bad, happy or sad or maybe numb but it is okay to let other feelings take over you. Let it fade. Don't hold onto something that you know will eventually fade cause the more you hold on the faster it will try to fade. Let new love, new friendships, new feelings take over. Sometimes if your anger or your hatred wants to take over, let them because they might ease your process of letting go."

To be honest, for the past few days I have been telling myself that I am enough and I need to learn to be enough but then I feel this unaware but a little familiar feeling at a point and it makes me wonder whether this feeling will make me weak? Will I always get this feeling and end up having a person in my life just to avoid this feeling? No matter what age you are or who you are with or what's your relationship status, this feeling can pop up in your head anytime. Does that mean you will always be alone or does not that mean you need more people in life? No matter how many people you have this feeling is going to pop us, it doesn't mean you are alone it just means that at that particular moment you are wanting something that will make you feel this feeling. Honestly, it is okay to have this feeling, I feel its reminder to us that we are humans and we need to feel like one, we need a moment of loneliness to realize we are not actual lonely and maybe that 3am craving, that feeling is nothing else but it is you realizing that you love yourself enough and that you are going to be fine."

Are we so afraid of being alone or losing people that we are ready to be okay with things we are not okay with? Sometimes we are in because we are afraid we won't get loved the same way or sometimes because we are used to that person or sometimes even because we know that person is our comfort zone, but what's the point? Being happy for a little while and then being unhappy for the rest of the time? What's better? temporary happiness or long term peace? Decisions made to ease our heart are most certainly to harm our future. When we say 'it's complicated' is it really complicated or is it just us, not able to decide between 'let things be how they are and let time decide' or 'take a decision and be strong enough to face it? isn't that a time where we should be asking ourselves is it worth it? this wait, these sleepless nights, these 24/7 clogging thoughts? and if not then why not be depressed for a while and be happy later? We always confuse love with temporary comfort. Sometimes it is not love it is the fear of being out there alone, starting again, loving yourself and losing yourself for someone again. is there an end to this complication? What if this complication comes within, what if we have our relationship complicated with our mind?

Turns out I am the kind of friend that believes in checking on everyone no matter how pumped up I am, but...I am out of so many people, if I come to think of it, I am a cave person who is surrounded by people who will only communicate if you do. How can they be so busy all the time that they cannot just once text you 'how have you been doing'? Don't we all want someone who texts us that? Then why don't we text that to others? Strange how we all want to be asked how we doing, how we all just want to be heard but we don't want to hear and only speak. True, the times are difficult and messed up but just one text can mean so much to someone, just one text can make one feel important or cared for. In the midst of being depressed is there any harm in one text? You see what happens is, the moment of realisation that your friendship is unrequited, unwillingly we start to feel as though something is missing, that the yearning of the friendship we always did has not stopped, we start to feel deserted and trust me it is worst than one-sided love because who will you tell about your unrequited love when you have an unrequited friendship? So if you have someone you legit care about, I would suggest you text them once a week 'how have you been'"

That person becomes something we conquered and don't want to let go. It becomes like the trophy that we keep in house and once in a while we just want to look at it and say 'I wanted that and I have that'. True, habits are difficult to lose and just because it's difficult, we keep that person. But isn't it wrong? Isn't it unfair to another person as well as to us? We can't compromise our habits, we shouldn't right? Love becoming a habit and that habit turning into a compromise is what is called a toxic relationship. Be it friendship or love or even enmity, you can't be clung to it because it is one of the reasons you wake up. After all, it might also become one of the reasons you don't want to wake up someday. It's a Dilemma to choose between temporary happiness or permanent peace. Yes, we should live in present but that doesn't mean living compromised happiness. Living peacefully is equally important or else you might miss out on the thing that is your present. Love becoming a habit is seen but Habit becoming love also exists. We start to love someone only because they become our habit. Getting used to love is not wrong but getting habitual of that one person is because unwillingly and sadly, the world is filled with uncertainty and that uncertainty is the reason getting attached to one person or the idea of having that person is scary and risky. Getting used to being love and the nit having anyone to love might still be less painful because self-love exists but what will you do the that one person leaves? Which is worse you ask, loving your habit or making a habit of your love? Both! Both are worse because in both cases your love is filtered, your love is selfish and comes with the baggage of needs, compromises, temporary happiness and you cannot love someone while you are compromising.

They might not have led a great historic life but even they might have a story to tell. I asked her, 'tell me how you were, what did you like?' she said, ' I wanted to wear long Western dresses, I loved to give ribbons to my friends when we use to fight, I wished to get photographed in a beautiful lehenga, I and your grandfather use to read to each other every night, I never liked cooking more than 3 hours and I always wanted to spend my Evening watching sunsets' saying this she looked at the drowning sun and smiled at me.

You begin to question whether your ambitions are attainable or if they're just distant fantasies. The fear of settling into an average existence with a mundane job and a modest income starts to gnaw at you. You find yourself drifting away from friends, seeing them in a new light, realizing that you don't have as many allies as you once thought. You start to feel inadequate despite your efforts, tallying up your blessings and finding them lacking. The urge to change, to become the person you've always envisioned, grows stronger, even as doubts about your ability to make that transformation linger. You're faced with a choice: conform to the expectations of others or forge your own path. As you grapple with the loss of relationships and the uncertainty of what lies ahead, you contemplate whether a fresh start—a new city, a new circle of friends—might offer the escape you crave. But you wonder if running away will only lead you back to the same unresolved issues, the same nagging doubts about who you are and who you want to become. In the midst of this breakdown, you come to realize that surviving it is a testament to your resilience. You let go of those who have left your life, seeking solace in new routines and new perspectives. You begin to value yourself more, recognizing that your worth isn't defined by others' opinions or your past mistakes. You understand that this moment of crisis is an opportunity for growth, a chance to redefine yourself on your own terms. And as you emerge from the depths of uncertainty, you find strength in the realization that you are the architect of your own destiny."

After all, you can't accept something if there Is no proof it existed in the first place right? I became the culprit for making myself the victim. I became guilty of being honest.

I started getting blamed for things I didn't do and I had to give explanations and justifications. I used to scream in my head and yell at people in my mind hoping someone would hear it but that's just like expecting a dead fish to swim. It took a lot of Pep talks, explanations, motivated Instagram reels and 3 novels to make me see things. Today I am better, taking a Stand for myself, trying to find the old me in transition to becoming a new me. I am Learning to let go and the advice that I am taking seriously given by 'Jay Shetty' is that I am finding a way to make peace with the fact that not everyone is going to understand me. Writing this is the first step to being me.. I don't know whether I am working towards getting out of the blank point or getting in it for good. I wondered for an hour on what topic to write on then I figured out why not start writing about what I am avoiding and not accepting. I think in the blank point in your life what matters is how you want to end up. Being the victim or being the survivor? Things might not go back to being the same and maybe it's good, maybe that's how it's supposed to be. Acceptance and change are hard. You can think of 1000 different possibilities of how you could have done things differently but they all would have ended up with the same consequences perhaps just with different collateral damages, so yeah blank points suck but it's inevitable.

        "body": "We are made to be a part of a race that only has an end but no reward for winning.People struggle, and work every day trying to achieve that one goal which May or may not be completed. 100s of questions run through our minds every minute, stream of insecurity flows. These questions don't let us remain happy. The unsolved problems don't let us be happy about what we have achieved. Just those typical questions like:-What is after this? Will this be sufficient? What If I do something which is not worth remembering? What has the future stored for me? What if something bad happens? What if I don't make it to where I want to be? What about the disappointment I am going to cause? Will I ever be happy? and so many more questions. We, humans, are stuck in a vicious cycle of these questions which has no satisfying answer, just a more complicated question in return. All the desire about living a long life comes to end when all you want to do is find peace in your day to day life. We have a lot of desires, expectations, a lot to accomplish, we want to give and have a certain kind of lifestyle, we want to be known, remember and loved and when all these desires tend to not get fulfilled that's when the main questions are raised which are, 'Was I ever good Enough?, What's the point of all this? Will I ever get to live these desires?' The moment these questions come to your mind is the moment you must realise that all your desires are going to come to an end whether or not they have been achieved because desires are never ending and nor are the questions. Having the desire to finish a race is not bad but the frustration and obsession to win the race, especially for a price that will only lead to lifelong incomplete happiness. Sometimes the best thing to do is a pause, and take a break, it's okay to watch people go ahead, check your tracks once in a while and instead of doubting yourself, appreciate the path you have covered. After all slow and steady wins the race right?"

        "body": "Change can be confusing, it is something that makes you feel a million emotions but do we like or dislike change? There are a lot of theories and opinions when we talk about change. Such is this theory. I feel change is everlasting. As much as we like to avoid change or delay change or give an emotion to change, it has its nature. For Example, I have heard people ask questions like: Aren't you tired of being old, aren't you bored living on the same schedule, aren't you tired of constantly pleasing others and so on The answer to all these questions is the same that yes, you do get tired of doing or being in the same situation and that is when you value change. There are three types of changes. First is when you need the change and second is when you hate change and third is when want to hate the change. When you turn into a new age, you are excited about it because you are tired of being of the same age for the whole year. Your birthday comes and you get a new age. Weeks pass and slowly that excitement starts to fade, you realise that with the new age comes change be it wanted or unwanted. You start to normalise that age, that feeling and it gets old and boring. You start feeling impatient about going forward and getting a new age again. Such is the process of change. First, you need a change then you start to hate that change and then you want a new change. It's a vicious cycle. We have a tendency that we want to experience different things now and then. Based on this tendency, we treat 'Change'. As much as we say that change is difficult, it is necessary even when we feel it's not. Everybody needs change, we just don't want to accept the change unless it pleases us. Rather than fussing about it, it is better to accept it because, without it, our life will be held still, it would boring with just days passing by.Talk about the negative change. The change after losing someone or the change after losing yourself is necessary because once in a while you need to lose yourself to know what changes are needed to be done to find yourself. The pain of losing someone can be seen as an alteration of ourselves because what we are after them is a change that might be painful but inevitable and it is what you need to grow."

        "body": "I have heard people say I am done and I am no longer going to do things for others but do we ever imply that? I have seen people questioning everything that they have done, from loving someone to losing someone. Loving someone gives you the obligation to do something for them and many a time it's done because of the expectation that the other person holds but what happens when even after doing everything in your capacity you still get to hear that 'You have not done Enough'. Can we ever do ENOUGH for someone? Is there a limit to expect from people to do something for us? The times when you are made to feel that you did not do enough for someone, all you need to do is ask yourself. If you feel you have done enough then there is no second question. When you try to see your efforts through someone else's eyes they will never be enough. You know you have done enough for someone when there is nothing else left to do or when you feel exhausted about the thought of doing more. For the people who keep asking 'What have you done for me', ask yourself whether you have ever appreciated the things they have done for you, be little things. Unless one does not appreciate the little things others do for them they will never be satisfied, they will always feel as if nobody has ever done anything for them. Appreciation plays an important role in any relationship, It is given and taken, when you appreciate something or someone or when you get appreciated for something or from someone, you know that you are seen, and your efforts are seen. Before you tell someone that they did not do enough for you, give yourself a second question about whether have you done the bare minimum for them. If you feel you have done a lot for someone and they are not reciprocating it then give this a thought. When you love a person you do things for them but why do you do that? Is it because you want things done for you in return or because one day you want to show them the list of things you did for them? What we do is on ourselves and what they do is on them. You can't do something for someone in return for something from them, that's trading. The act of doing should be unconditional so that when the time comes to stop that act, it is a choice, not an ultimatum. Here is the truth, you are doing something for a person out of love not out of this expectation that they will do something for you in return. That's not love to expect that you should get a gesture for a gesture. Everyone has different ways of showing love or doing things and just because it doesn't match your idea of love or your idea of what they should have done doesn't mean they are not doing enough."

        "body": "They say one sided love hurts, some say being in love hurts, some say hating the person you loved hurts but there is one more category that hurts, pretending to love someone. How do you convince yourself that it isn't love anymore but mere attachment or care? You find yourself pretending, You are with them but there is an invisible wall in between. Every time you say “I love you” it feels as if You are forcing yourself to believe in something that doesn’t exist anymore. You find yourself getting distant, being on your own even when they are around, You don't care like you use to. It hurts when they look at you with hopes that you will love them back. The heart-aching part is when they don’t notice that you are not in love with them anymore. How do you talk to someone about this? What do you even tell them? Do make yourself fall in love with them again? or is this the most asked question as to why it happens? The little cuts that we leave to heal themselves sometimes get deeper. When fights lose their purpose, when you feel the need to pursue yourself to imagine a life without them when there is no way to end the fight when the person stops exciting you with their presence, when you feel dejected by them, you don't feel like correcting them when they have misunderstood you, you chose to keep quiet instead of communicating, when you feel love is not enough, it is then you know you are falling out of love. A relationship usually ends in two ways, either one partner breaks up or you mutually decide to call quits. The third type is falling out of love. You may feel at that time that you owe them something and you try to repay them by being with them but that isn't going to make you feel better but worse. Pretending to love someone is worse than leaving them. You will start to resent them, you will feel more guilty with every day passing by. Your mind will wander and imagine the possibilities of things you would have done had you not been in that relationship. You will start to feel suffocated and search for a reason to leave them and when you fail to find the reason, you will create one. There is no closure in a situation like this. Love can have different timelines and it's not in your control to extend or reduce that timeline. To answer the question as to why this happens has no definite answer. Things can be on cloud 9 and you can still fall out of love. Perhaps it's because of the tricks our mind plays on us. We can never be satisfied with what we have, there is always going to be that 'little' more that we will crave. It's a human tendency to want a little more. The environment around us will somehow make us feel what we have is not enough, there are so many things that a person can do to express the love that one can never be content. The want for more can also contribute to the factor of falling out of love. When it happens, the fallout, the wise thing to do is to accept it instead of questioning it or fixing it. You can't change the way you feel. It will hurt but pretending will hurt more."

        "body": "The most common concern among us humans is that we are too scared to be alone. We would rather have bad company than no company. The mistake that we often make is we keep ourselves busy with any stuff or people we get so that we don't have to be alone. We say we love ourselves but often feel the need to be with someone or sometimes anyone. The thing we don't let ourselves feel is the love we feel when we are alone with our thoughts. We don't need someone to stand with us near the window when the weather is windy and cloudy and rainy, I know it's supposed to be romantic but we can be romantic with ourselves too. We can think about the good times we spent with ourselves. We don't need someone to take us on a long drive when the night is beautiful, we don't need someone to drink tea with when it's a good rainy evening, and we don't need someone for walks on the beach. The need of having someone is nothing but fear, maybe its the fear that if we start being content with ourselves and don't be much around people then the proof of our existence would get less, the number of witnesses to tell how amazing we are will get less in the count but that's the thing, you don't need a someone as a proof or witness to tell the world how amazing you are. when you start enjoying being alone, going alone to the movies, going on coffee dates alone, and riding alone, the world becomes your witness because you are doing what millions of people are afraid of doing. The difference between being lonely and being alone is that one is the state of mind and the other is the state of reality. State of mind can be changed by accepting reality, which is easier said than done. Exploring yourself can be a good pass time because you can never really know yourself completely. Different situations and different people bring out different parts and versions of ourselves. Maybe if we knew ourselves the way we claim that we know ourselves, then dealing with situations would have been easy."

        "body": "Holding onto your past is not always painful, sometimes it's a comfort we look for. When things go the wrong way or there is a decision to make we usually look back for help or we cannot help but think about the past. People tend to find answers to their problems in the past. Anytime the future looks scary we turn to our past and there are ways to do that. The most common way is to talk to the people who were a part of the past. I have witnessed people going back and talking to their ex-partners or people who are no more holding the same value in their present but that does not give you the answer to your problem. The reason we go to them is that they have seen different versions of ourselves and they know how to deal with those versions but the new people who are unaware of those versions may give us the fear of getting judged or abandoned. We talk to them because we feel comfortable around them, showing them the vulnerable side. It may also be because we have got so habitual to the way they deal with us that we don't have to face the new approach new people bring towards us but that's not growing that's just called getting the comfort of your past for a temporary period. There was a reason that those people don't hold the same position in your life then getting comfort from them will only cause discomfort in future. It's not a bad idea to want to learn from your past mistakes. People who you have left behind are a reminder of the mistakes you don't want to repeat which is why involving them in future will only lead to future mistakes. No matter how much comfort they give, it is only until the point you realise that this same person was the reason you decided to move on and change your life in certain ways. People in the past on incidents of the past can be a guide but it cannot be carried along with you in case of a new emergency. Comfort can be found in the present. Initially, people with a new approach would feel uncomfortable with you but were your past once new to you? So if they can be your temporary comfort then why can't new people be your more than temporary comfort? It's true that they may know a lot about you and there are things that no one but only they made you feel but that can not be the justified reason to go back to them."

        "body": "We tend to have a lot of expectations from the beginning of the year and as the year comes to an end either those expectations get carried to a new year or they die with the old one. Do you ever wonder why we put ourselves under so much pressure to celebrate the new year or to end the year on a good note? There are so many new things to start, goals to be achieved, some toxic people to block or some new relationships to begin but we wait for that one day, one new day to do all this. Some times it's the endless tomorrows, Mondays or new month beginnings but it keeps getting procrastinated for some or the other reason. I feel we put pressure on the new year because it gives us a perfect chance to do things we waited to do for a whole year. Perhaps Change a job, give someone a second chance, a new workout plan, a new destination to visit, an unfulfilled wish to fulfil or sometimes even give oneself a chance to live a good life instead of just surviving a year. A new year can be different for everyone. For people who barely survived this year, it can be a second chance to them. For people who made mistakes this year, a near year can be a chance for them to fix things. A new year comes with a lot of uncountable chances. New Year is pressured because it holds the disappointment of the past and the expectations of the future. It can either make or break you. We make resolutions, hoping the new year will be different. We expect the new year to be kind, and humble and help us succeed in our expectations which is why maybe we sometimes keep unrealistic expectations from the near year in the hope that if not this year then the next new year will fulfil them. Gradually as the month goes by we start the new year for granted because there always be a new year. A new one carries so much weight. From people who are not ready to grow up to people who can't wait to already end this year, a new year welcomes all with open arms. It can be just a change of numbers for some but for some, it is an opportunity waiting to happen. 31st and 1st of December and January hold the same body but different persons."

After a lot of alarms, schedules, morning coffees, application of the perfect tinted happy face blush and a lot of incomplete, inattentive thoughts later, today I decided to attend to those thoughts and see what they make me feel. I realised how the child in me slowly died and how I was forced to grow up. It's the people that we surround ourselves with who determine how we are going to learn our life lessons. After losing almost every person that I never wanted to lose, it hit me that I need to find a way around people leaving, by choice or by the situation. It's the human tendency to obsess over things that are not in our control. We imagine the worst possible thing, in hope that when or if it happens we are ready for it but that's just self-sabotaging. Making yourself go through that situation which never existed in the first place is like wearing a raincoat all season to prevent from getting wet. I have made myself go through the worst thoughts only to realise that no matter what happens, expected or unexpected, I have to face it anyway and I have to move on from it anyway. My attachment towards other humans scares me, it is partly the reason I am so miserable. Loving something or someone is not wrong but letting that or them have control over you is self-sabotaging. I have asked myself why the people who hurt me, hurt me and every time I am left with more questions. The time I spent justifying their actions should have been the time I accept their actions. Every time I worry about the future I can't control or people I can't stop from going is the time I am self-sabotaging. The real justice that needs to be done is with ourselves. We start as innocent kids wanting to change things around us but we turn into adults trying to control everything around us, We deserve a break, we deserve happy thoughts, and self-pampering and those are only possible when we stop self-sabotaging. Others can sabotage you only after you sabotage yourself first."
