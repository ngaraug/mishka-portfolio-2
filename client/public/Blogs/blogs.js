Life seems very short when you have a partner and very long and when you don’t so if you have why not keep them forever. Why not fight for `us’ instead of `me’ why not fight to stay why not fight so that nothing comes along your beautiful relation. Why not know the difference between holding on and letting go!"

A future which comes out of all the incomplete dreams and the disappointments of today, but what guarantee do we have that the future we see today has a chance of coming true? Are we suppose to imagine a future and expect it to go the same way? if not then why imagine a future? Humans are the kind which survive on hopes and our hope is future. Imagining a future only gives pain. why you may ask. it’s because we expect something to come true which has come out of our imagination. We accomplish our dreams but can we accomplish our future plans. The difference between dreams and future is that, dreams are our imaginations of what we want in our life but future, it is a hope of what we want our lives to look like. The only way to not fear from the fear of future is to stick to our dreams, is to know that even if things don't go the way we wanted them, there is always a loophole. A loophole into something unexpected and something beautiful."

If it is then why do people search for so many answers and cure to loneliness? There is this feeling you get where you don’t know what exactly you want, what exactly is the thing that is bothering you and no matter how much you try to tell yourself that it is okay, you know it’s not. Sometimes all you need is assurance that it’s okay to be happy alone, and that assurance can be given to you by none but you. Maybe a look outside, or a heartfelt song, or a quote, or a selfie can make that happen. There are times when the noise of fireworks gives a soothing feeling, reassuring us we are not alone. There are days when all you want is noise, crowd, chaos around you, and even though those days seem bad but they bring out the best in us."

I one day found myself questioning that will I ever get someone to do all that stuff for me and the answer to that question is still vague. one day I decided to do all that stuff for myself. Woke up and greeted myself, got dressed ( for myself), went out, and did everything I wanted someone else to do and it felt so good. True, we would like to have someone in our life who does things for us but not cause we can't do it ourselves, the feeling of someone's existence in our life I great but not at the cost of losing one own's. Sometimes some people get the perfect partner and it works for life and sometimes no matter what we do it just doesn't works. Maybe the problem is us cause we are trying too hard, maybe if we just sit back and get busy trying loving ourself than maybe we won't try or try to find that one person. and as they say we shouldn't need someone we should want them so why not apply it? There are times you may feel incomplete but the missing person is not them it’s you, the missing thing is the realisation that the incomplete spot is your heart's way of reminding that it needs your love and time.

Who gets to decide what a grown-up is like and what surety is there that grown-ups don't mess things up? Sometimes people at 60 need to grow up. Let's define what is grown-ups. Making the right choice? taking the right decision? talking in a manner? getting good grades? what is that define grown-ups cause as far as I have seen the grown-ups I know have made mistakes. We never really grow up. do we? Even the right decisions lead to some unhappy times, even good grades can't assure manners. Humans are complicated and emotional which why no matter how \"GROWN UP\" we are, we will always do things that will make us feel we need to grow up but there is such thing called all grown up cause we are going to keep doing stupid things no matter how old we are or how experienced we are so instead of saying Grow Up shouldn't we say experience more. I think one is never ready to grow up because everybody has that one little innocent part in them which makes them want to stop growing up. We all have that one voice inside us which provokes us to take hasty decisions, a part which is curious to know where our other decisions will take us. After all don't we all want to stop growing up?"

Our generation isn't satisfied with only money, a little part of us wants to be known, wants to be recognized, appreciated. Our generation is competitive, not necessarily with others but with their selves as well. We question what our future holds for ourselves too early and when we see young people are achieving things, we start to ask this question more often to ourselves. We get this feeling that if they can do then why can't we and slowly its pile a negative thought. Having ambition at a young age is progressive but achieving those at that same age is not obligatory. If our generation can normalize fear of social media, fear of looks, and beauty then I guess our generation can normalize being confused at the age of 24. True we live in a world where making your own identity is everything but being recognized for it is a great thing but it is okay if your identity is known by a few people. Sometimes it's not about how much or how many recognitions you get sometimes it's about the small achievements, even though those achievements aren't a big deal in your resume but those achievements are a small reminder for you that you did it, you created your own small identity. For days I felt that I am just a useless 19-year-old making reels and not get appreciated but then I came to this realization that the reels I made gave me happiness and even if my reels crossed just 1000 views that are an achievement. It's great if you have it all figured out at just 19 but it's also okay to still be figuring it all out at 25. The question of what the future holds is scary but it's not always necessary to ask that."

What happens when two such people meet? one with lots of hidden emotions and one who is prepared to not feel emotions. They destruct each other. One wrecks the other by overwhelming emotions and the other makes you want to think about how you feel things. In both cases which one do you think can survive? Makes you want to think about which one are you. sometimes we feel emotions which are not needed to be felt cause those emotions just hit you with no intention of making you do something about them so isn't leaving those emotions a right decision to make? I believe that we are never completely done with any emotion I feel the emotion just takes over and someday you get a pile of unfelt emotions. We don't really have the time to get over one emotion. do we? All we do leave that emotion half felt and start to feel another. So what happens to those unfelt emotions? They become stationery items, items we only remember when we need to create or destroy something."

It might be true, you never really get over someone, you just start to get a more strong and different feeling for someone else. I always wondered what happens to the old feelings but I finally got the answer. They fade, they don't wipe out completely but they fade. Sometimes it is because you are done feeling that feeling, sometimes it is because you overcame that feeling, sometimes it’s because you don't get time to think about that feeling, or sometimes cause you are drained, drained from that feeling and you get so used to that feeling that eventually, it stops bothering you. Someday, at some point that feeling might be remembered but not with the same emotion. You might feel right now that this will never fade or you will never get over it but you will, willingly or unwillingly you will. There is no guarantee when, how or with what you will overcome that feeling but you will cause there will come a time when you will start to feel something else. Good or bad, happy or sad or maybe numb but it is okay to let other feelings take over you. Let it fade. Don't hold onto something that you know will eventually fade cause the more you hold on the faster it will try to fade. Let new love, new friendships, new feelings take over. Sometimes if your anger or your hatred wants to take over, let them because they might ease your process of letting go."

To be honest, for the past few days I have been telling myself that I am enough and I need to learn to be enough but then I feel this unaware but a little familiar feeling at a point and it makes me wonder whether this feeling will make me weak? Will I always get this feeling and end up having a person in my life just to avoid this feeling? No matter what age you are or who you are with or what's your relationship status, this feeling can pop up in your head anytime. Does that mean you will always be alone or does not that mean you need more people in life? No matter how many people you have this feeling is going to pop us, it doesn't mean you are alone it just means that at that particular moment you are wanting something that will make you feel this feeling. Honestly, it is okay to have this feeling, I feel its reminder to us that we are humans and we need to feel like one, we need a moment of loneliness to realize we are not actual lonely and maybe that 3am craving, that feeling is nothing else but it is you realizing that you love yourself enough and that you are going to be fine."

Are we so afraid of being alone or losing people that we are ready to be okay with things we are not okay with? Sometimes we are in because we are afraid we won't get loved the same way or sometimes because we are used to that person or sometimes even because we know that person is our comfort zone, but what's the point? Being happy for a little while and then being unhappy for the rest of the time? What's better? temporary happiness or long term peace? Decisions made to ease our heart are most certainly to harm our future. When we say 'it's complicated' is it really complicated or is it just us, not able to decide between 'let things be how they are and let time decide' or 'take a decision and be strong enough to face it? isn't that a time where we should be asking ourselves is it worth it? this wait, these sleepless nights, these 24/7 clogging thoughts? and if not then why not be depressed for a while and be happy later? We always confuse love with temporary comfort. Sometimes it is not love it is the fear of being out there alone, starting again, loving yourself and losing yourself for someone again. is there an end to this complication? What if this complication comes within, what if we have our relationship complicated with our mind?

Turns out I am the kind of friend that believes in checking on everyone no matter how pumped up I am, but...I am out of so many people, if I come to think of it, I am a cave person who is surrounded by people who will only communicate if you do. How can they be so busy all the time that they cannot just once text you 'how have you been doing'? Don't we all want someone who texts us that? Then why don't we text that to others? Strange how we all want to be asked how we doing, how we all just want to be heard but we don't want to hear and only speak. True, the times are difficult and messed up but just one text can mean so much to someone, just one text can make one feel important or cared for. In the midst of being depressed is there any harm in one text? You see what happens is, the moment of realisation that your friendship is unrequited, unwillingly we start to feel as though something is missing, that the yearning of the friendship we always did has not stopped, we start to feel deserted and trust me it is worst than one-sided love because who will you tell about your unrequited love when you have an unrequited friendship? So if you have someone you legit care about, I would suggest you text them once a week 'how have you been'"

That person becomes something we conquered and don't want to let go. It becomes like the trophy that we keep in house and once in a while we just want to look at it and say 'I wanted that and I have that'. True, habits are difficult to lose and just because it's difficult, we keep that person. But isn't it wrong? Isn't it unfair to another person as well as to us? We can't compromise our habits, we shouldn't right? Love becoming a habit and that habit turning into a compromise is what is called a toxic relationship. Be it friendship or love or even enmity, you can't be clung to it because it is one of the reasons you wake up. After all, it might also become one of the reasons you don't want to wake up someday. It's a Dilemma to choose between temporary happiness or permanent peace. Yes, we should live in present but that doesn't mean living compromised happiness. Living peacefully is equally important or else you might miss out on the thing that is your present. Love becoming a habit is seen but Habit becoming love also exists. We start to love someone only because they become our habit. Getting used to love is not wrong but getting habitual of that one person is because unwillingly and sadly, the world is filled with uncertainty and that uncertainty is the reason getting attached to one person or the idea of having that person is scary and risky. Getting used to being love and the nit having anyone to love might still be less painful because self-love exists but what will you do the that one person leaves? Which is worse you ask, loving your habit or making a habit of your love? Both! Both are worse because in both cases your love is filtered, your love is selfish and comes with the baggage of needs, compromises, temporary happiness and you cannot love someone while you are compromising.

They might not have led a great historic life but even they might have a story to tell. I asked her, 'tell me how you were, what did you like?' she said, ' I wanted to wear long Western dresses, I loved to give ribbons to my friends when we use to fight, I wished to get photographed in a beautiful lehenga, I and your grandfather use to read to each other every night, I never liked cooking more than 3 hours and I always wanted to spend my Evening watching sunsets' saying this she looked at the drowning sun and smiled at me. I asked 'what happened to your story, why didn't you ever tell me?' she said 'I did, but it went unheard.' hearing that I realised she has so much to say so many Beautiful incidents to tell but no one to hear her. if she has her story to tell then so does my grandfather who today tries to cope with my generation given at his age he had no comforts.

What is their life stories are hidden gems we will never get to hear? Apart from me wishes to see how they grew old. How did they express love to each other in different ways or how they made up with their friends or how they found happiness in little things they got to do here and there.

You begin to question whether your ambitions are attainable or if they're just distant fantasies. The fear of settling into an average existence with a mundane job and a modest income starts to gnaw at you. You find yourself drifting away from friends, seeing them in a new light, realizing that you don't have as many allies as you once thought. You start to feel inadequate despite your efforts, tallying up your blessings and finding them lacking. The urge to change, to become the person you've always envisioned, grows stronger, even as doubts about your ability to make that transformation linger. You're faced with a choice: conform to the expectations of others or forge your own path. As you grapple with the loss of relationships and the uncertainty of what lies ahead, you contemplate whether a fresh start—a new city, a new circle of friends—might offer the escape you crave. But you wonder if running away will only lead you back to the same unresolved issues, the same nagging doubts about who you are and who you want to become. In the midst of this breakdown, you come to realize that surviving it is a testament to your resilience. You let go of those who have left your life, seeking solace in new routines and new perspectives. You begin to value yourself more, recognizing that your worth isn't defined by others' opinions or your past mistakes. You understand that this moment of crisis is an opportunity for growth, a chance to redefine yourself on your own terms. And as you emerge from the depths of uncertainty, you find strength in the realization that you are the architect of your own destiny."
